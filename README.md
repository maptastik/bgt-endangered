# Blue Grass Trust Endangered Properties Map App

This project serves a few purposes:

1. To spatially ground the BGT's list of endangered properties in Central Kentucky. While the current list has no doubt informed many about the at-risk built cultural landscape in the region, it may be easier for people to connect to these places if they can understand them within a geographic context.
2. For me to learn better how to use [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to build useful web applications. I recently I recently tried [Ben Welsh's guide](http://first-news-app.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to building a simple map application using Python (via the Flask framework), HTML, and JavaScript. This used demo data of the 60 people who died in Los Angeles during the 1992 riots. After successfully completing the tutorial, I wanted to find a way to use it to help inform people about a particular theme in my local setting of Central Kentucky. When I saw BGT's list I decided it would be a perfect topic for this sort of application!
